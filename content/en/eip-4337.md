title: Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool

## Abstract

An account abstraction proposal that completely avoids consensus-layer protocol changes, instead relying on higher-layer infrastructure.

## ChatGPT4

ERC-4337 proposes a standardized interface for account abstraction in Ethereum. This interface defines a set of functions and data structures that contracts can implement to enable advanced transaction processing capabilities. The goal is to provide more flexibility and control over transaction execution, enabling a wide range of use cases and optimizations.

The main idea behind account abstraction is to separate the transaction execution logic from the standard Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution flow. Instead of relying solely on the EVM's built-in execution model, account abstraction allows for alternative execution models to be implemented, enabling more complex transaction processing and optimizations.

By implementing the ERC-4337 interface, contracts can customize various aspects of transaction execution, such as gas computation, signature verification, and state access. This allows for the development of advanced features like gasless transactions, meta-transactions, and more efficient transaction processing.
